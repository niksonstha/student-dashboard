<div>
  <!-- if you are binding some variable to the html you can either use $ctrl which represents the controller binded to the html using templateUrl or template in the component intialization -->
  <h1>{{$ctrl.name}}</h1>
  <!-- you can also give special alias to controllers in the component using controllerAs: nikson 
    angular.module('myApp').component('studentList', {
      templateUrl: "student-list/student-list.template.html",
      controllerAs: "$nikson",
      controller: function () {
        this.name = "Nikson Shrestha"
      }
    });
  which would've allowed you do to something like {{$nikson.name}} in the above html, by convention we append $ symbol to represent controller
  -->
